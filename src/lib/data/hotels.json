The resort has exclusive cottages with swimming pool and games rooms which have billiards, table tennis, carom and chess.| Hotel is within close vicinity of several tourist attraction such as Bhimtal, Sat Tal, Naukuchiatal, Nainital, Ramgarh and Muketshwar.| The guests also find the car parking, souvenir shop, car rental, and sightseeing. The entire Resort is built with traditional Kumaoni stone giving it the look of an old Himalayan village with its entire gracious splendour.| The restaurant is open air with a sturdy stone pillar supporting a shed roof over the tables. The multi cuisine fare is served at the restaurant while you can also choose to have your meals by the pool side which is tree-shaded as well. | This property evokes the mountains in its stone-and-wood architecture. Beautifully built, the reception cum lobby is the entry point which is like a 'machan' propped up on wooden rafters with stone railings.| Trees sway all around, casting deep shadows and the rolling gardens have three rather grim looking, well, monolith effigies. Rightfully, the resort has been the winner of the 'Indian Architecture Award.|",
